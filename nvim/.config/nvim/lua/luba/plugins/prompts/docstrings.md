Google-style docstrings in Python follow a specific structure to ensure consistency and readability. Here's a breakdown of the key components:
### Summary Line
A brief description of the function, class, or module on a single line. It should be concise and start with a capital letter, ending with a period.
### Detailed Explanation
A more in-depth explanation of the functionality, which can span multiple lines and paragraphs. It should be separated from the summary line by a blank line.
### Sections
Specific sections to detail parameters, return values, and exceptions. These sections are introduced with a header followed by a colon and indented text. 
Args: Lists the parameters of the function, including their type (optional) and description.
Returns: Describes the return value of the function, including its type (optional).
Raises: Lists any exceptions that the function might raise, along with a description of when they are raised.
Examples: Provides examples of how to use the function, often in a code block.
### Example

```python
def example_function(param1, param2):
    """This is a brief summary of the function.

    This is a more detailed explanation of what the function does. It
    can span multiple lines and paragraphs.

    Args:
        param1 (int): Description of the first parameter.
        param2 (str): Description of the second parameter.

    Returns:
        bool: True if successful, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the input parameters are not of the correct type.

    Examples:
        >>> example_function(1, "hello")
        True
        >>> example_function("invalid", 2)
        TypeError
    """
    if not isinstance(param1, int) or not isinstance(param2, str):
        raise TypeError("Input parameters must be an integer and a string.")
    return True
```

### Additional Considerations
Indentation: Use consistent indentation for all sections and descriptions.
Type Annotations: While not mandatory, type annotations can be included in the docstring or as part of the function signature.
Consistency: Choose one style (Google or NumPy) and stick to it for the entire project.
Clarity: Write docstrings that are clear, concise, and easy to understand.
By following these guidelines, you can create well-documented Python code that is easier to use and maintain.
